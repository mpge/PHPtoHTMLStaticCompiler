# PHPtoHTMLStaticCompiler
A really simple script to compile PHP files to static HTML (using a beautifier). Convenient when you want to use things like partials but your clients want static HTML files.

## Usage

Simply follow/edit the settings within the generate_output_html_files.php script, and then run the following command via terminal:

```
php generate_output_html_files.php
```
